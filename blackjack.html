        Blackjack with a Computer

        <li>Cards dealing:</li>
        You are dealt two cards each whilst the dealer is dealt one face up. If
        your first 2 cards add up to 21 (an Ace and a card valued 10), that’s
        Blackjack! If they have any other total, decide whether you wish to hit
        or stand. You can continue to draw cards until you are happy with your
        hand.

        <li>Player's Turn:</li>
        If the player has a total card value of 21 from the initial deal (an Ace
        and a 10-value card), it's a Blackjack. If the dealer does not also have
        Blackjack, the player wins. The player can decide to "Hit", which means
        taking an additional card to increase their hand value. The player can
        keep "Hitting" until they decide to "Stand" or their total card value
        exceeds 21, which is called a "bust". If the player busts, the dealer
        wins.

        <li>Dealer's Turn:</li>
        Once the player stands or busts, it's the dealer's turn. The dealer
        reveals their hidden card. The dealer will continue to "Hit" until their
        hand value is 17 or higher. If the dealer's hand value exceeds 21, the
        dealer "busts" and the player wins (unless the player also busted
        earlier).

        <li>Determining the Winner:</li>
        If neither the dealer nor the player busts, the hand with the highest
        total card value wins. If both the dealer and the player have the same
        hand value, it's a tie.

        <li>Aces:</li>
        An Ace can be valued as either 1 or 11, depending on which value
        benefits the hand more.
        <p>Enjoy the game!</p>
